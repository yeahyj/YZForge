# Funplay Cocos UI Composition

## Instructions

## Operating Loop

1. Inspect before editing.
   - Confirm the active scene, Canvas, design resolution, Fit Width/Fit Height policy, target orientations, SafeArea usage, and relevant prefab asset paths.
   - Inspect the existing hierarchy, `UITransform` sizes and anchor points, `Widget` constraints and align modes, `Layout` ownership, sibling order, render order, serialized references, animation targets, and prefab instance state.
   - Treat screenshots and design coordinates as visual intent, not as permission to replace a working hierarchy.
2. Classify each region.
   - Mark art as full-bleed or safe-area content.
   - Mark placement as edge-aligned by Widget, stretched between edges, content-sized by Layout, repeated content, scrollable content, modal, overlay, or world-space UI.
   - Decide which system owns position and size. Avoid letting Widget, Layout, animation, and manual code fight over the same property.
3. Make the smallest coherent change.
   - Preserve the prefab root, existing children, components, names, UUID-backed references, animation tracks, nested prefab links, and scene overrides unless a specific replacement is required.
   - Modify only the necessary nodes, components, fields, and children; do not rebuild the entire prefab unless explicitly requested.
   - Prefer Cocos MCP scene, prefab, and asset-db workflows over generic text replacement for serialized assets.
4. Read back and validate.
   - Read exact hierarchy, node UUIDs, `UITransform` sizes and anchors, Widget edges, Layout settings, sprites, labels, opacity, input blockers, event bindings, and prefab ownership back from Cocos.
   - Test layout, input, safe area, localization, animation interruption, close/reopen state, and runtime data changes.
   - Capture preview screenshots at representative aspect ratios. Use native builds on representative devices before claiming device performance or platform validation.

## Component Selection

| Component | Use it for | Configure deliberately | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Canvas` | Root 2D/UI render space and design-resolution adaptation | Verify project design resolution, Fit Width/Fit Height, camera and layer behavior | Adding duplicate Canvases only to organize folders or assuming one resolution fits every aspect ratio |
| `UITransform` | UI size, anchor point, coordinate conversion, hit testing, and render priority | Set `contentSize` and anchor point intentionally; keep scale for visual effects rather than basic layout | Treating one screenshot position as universal or changing scale when size/Widget constraints should change |
| `Widget` | Edge, center, stretch, and parent-relative alignment | Choose top/bottom/left/right/center constraints and `ONCE`, `ON_WINDOW_RESIZE`, or `ALWAYS` based on runtime needs | Animating properties that an `ALWAYS` Widget rewrites at the end of the frame |
| `SafeArea` | Keeping critical controls inside notches and system gesture areas | Put it on the top interaction container; allow full-bleed backgrounds outside it | Applying safe-area insets twice or placing important controls outside the safe rectangle |
| `Layout` | Horizontal, vertical, or grid arrangement and container/child resizing | Choose type, resize mode, padding, spacing, constraint, and start axis; call `updateLayout` only when same-frame measurement is necessary | Putting Layout and Widget on the same node or manually positioning children driven by Layout |
| `Sprite` | Icons, panels, progress fills, and sliced or tiled UI art | Use sliced frames for scalable borders, preserve SpriteFrame references, and choose fill/type intentionally | Stretching bordered art as a simple Sprite or leaving decorative nodes interactive |
| `Label` / `RichText` | Localized text and formatted text | Set fonts, fallback coverage, alignment, wrapping, line height, overflow, and cache mode from actual update frequency | Broad `SHRINK` use on frequently changing labels or shipping without required CJK and symbol glyphs |
| `ScrollView` + `Mask` | Content larger than a viewport | Use a dedicated view/mask and content node, enable only required axes, and configure inertia, brake, bounce, and nested input deliberately | Combining Widget and Layout on the same Content node, or creating thousands of live rows without pooling |
| `Mask` | Rectangular, ellipse, graphics, or sprite-stencil clipping | Match the mask type to the visual requirement and keep renderer constraints in mind | Adding Sprite or Label renderers to a Mask node where Cocos requires the mask-owned Graphics/Sprite |
| `Button`, `Toggle`, `Slider`, `EditBox` | Semantic interaction | Verify transition state, target node, event handlers, hit area, keyboard/focus behavior, and disabled state | Duplicate event bindings, tiny touch targets, or visual-only disabled states |
| `UIOpacity` | Fading a UI subtree | Coordinate opacity with active state and input blocking | Hiding a modal visually while it still receives or blocks input |
| `BlockInputEvents` | Preventing pointer/touch events from passing through overlays and modals | Put it on the intended blocking region and validate sibling order and active state | Assuming a visible scrim blocks gameplay input by itself |
| `PageView` | Paged horizontal or vertical content | Recompute page and content sizes when the viewport changes and test drag thresholds | Hard-coding page positions from one device width |

## Design Resolution, Widget, and Safe Area

- Treat the design resolution as the coordinate baseline, not a physical-device whitelist. Verify the project Fit Width/Fit Height policy and any runtime `view.setDesignResolutionSize` policy before changing layout.
- Use Widget to express attachment and stretch. Use `ON_WINDOW_RESIZE` for resizable desktop/web or large-screen layouts, and use `ALWAYS` only when continuous alignment is worth its property ownership cost.
- When Widget owns an edge or size, change the Widget offsets or align mode rather than writing a Node position or UITransform size that will be overwritten later.
- Keep UI scale at one for ordinary layout. Resize through `UITransform.contentSize`, Widget constraints, Layout properties, or a deliberate design-resolution policy.
- Put decorative backgrounds outside the SafeArea interaction root so they can bleed to physical edges. Put buttons, labels, navigation, and other critical content under SafeArea.
- SafeArea already obtains `sys.getSafeAreaRect` and adjusts through Widget. Do not add a second manual inset unless the project has a documented additional margin.
- Re-evaluate layout on window resize, orientation change, or safe-area change when the target platform can change dimensions at runtime.

## Portrait and Landscape Patterns

- For portrait screens, organize persistent UI into Top, flexible Center, and Bottom regions. Let tall screens expand the center instead of multiplying every vertical coordinate by aspect ratio.
- For landscape screens, use Left, Center, Right, and stable corner regions. Verify 16:9, ultrawide, 16:10, and 4:3 instead of treating landscape as one shape.
- Separate camera/world composition from Canvas UI adaptation. A correct Widget layout does not prove the gameplay camera shows the intended world area.
- Use alternate art or deliberate cover/crop behavior when one background cannot preserve composition across phone, tablet, and desktop aspect ratios.
- Reposition only regions whose composition genuinely changes. Do not fork or rebuild the entire screen prefab for a few aspect-dependent offsets.

## Auto Layout and Dynamic Content

- A Layout component drives its children or container according to `ResizeMode`. Do not manually write the driven dimensions and expect them to survive the next layout update.
- For `ResizeMode.CHILDREN`, verify the container size and the resulting child sizes. For `ResizeMode.CONTAINER`, verify anchor point and growth direction so the container expands predictably.
- Grid Layout uses its configured cell and constraint policy. Use fixed rows or columns deliberately and do not expect heterogeneous child preferred sizes to define every cell.
- Runtime Layout property changes normally settle on the next frame. Call `updateLayout` only when code must read the final result in the same operation.
- Keep nested Layout chains shallow, batch data changes, pool repeated items, and avoid rebuilding a large hierarchy for every small model update.

## Sprites, Text, Scrolling, and Input

- Use sliced SpriteFrames for scalable bordered panels and buttons. Preserve caps/insets and inspect the actual SpriteFrame reference after prefab edits.
- For Label, choose `CLAMP`, `SHRINK`, or `RESIZE_HEIGHT` from a documented overflow policy. `SHRINK` can cost more CPU when text updates; `RESIZE_HEIGHT` transfers height ownership to the label.
- Choose Label cache mode from content behavior: avoid caching assumptions for highly dynamic text, and verify character coverage and atlas capacity for localized content.
- Structure a ScrollView as root, masked view, and content. Enable only the needed direction, verify the content reference, and test child-button cancellation and nested scroll behavior.
- Keep one intentional interactive target per control, bind events once, and validate the serialized target, component, handler, and custom event data.
- Give touch controls a project-defined minimum hit area even when the visible art is smaller. Verify with preview input rather than only inspecting dimensions.
- Synchronize modal visibility, `UIOpacity`, active state, Button interactability, and `BlockInputEvents` so hidden panels neither receive nor leak input.

## Animation and Prefab Safety

- Animate a `Visual` or `Container` child when the root is driven by Widget or Layout. Do not animate a property that layout rewrites every frame.
- Stop or cancel an existing tween/animation before replaying it and restore deterministic position, scale, opacity, active state, and input blocking on disable or close.
- Use unscaled scheduling or an explicit UI clock when menus and modal transitions must continue while gameplay time scale is zero.
- Preserve existing prefab objects by default. Replacing a prefab hierarchy can break internal object IDs, animation tracks, serialized component references, nested prefabs, and scene overrides even when the asset UUID remains stable.
- Prefer serialized references and stable semantic names over repeated `getChildByPath` lookups. If a path is required, verify it and fail clearly rather than silently creating an alternate hierarchy.

## Performance and Validation

- Profile before restructuring. Common UI costs include excessive nodes, draw-call breaks, masks/stencils, overdraw, dynamic text generation, repeated Layout work, and large unpooled lists.
- Preserve render batching by grouping compatible sprites and materials without changing intended sibling/render order. Use dynamic atlas or static batching only after verifying asset eligibility and runtime behavior.
- Use `get_performance_snapshot` to compare node, component, UI, depth, and memory-oriented counters before and after material changes.
- Validate portrait at 16:9, 19.5:9 or 20:9, a cutout phone, and a portrait tablet. Validate landscape at 16:9, ultrawide, 16:10, 4:3, and both cutout sides.
- In every profile, verify full-bleed art, safe interactive content, text overflow and glyphs, scroll bounds, modal blocking, touch targets, animation interruption, and close/reopen state.
